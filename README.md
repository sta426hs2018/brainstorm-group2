1. DNA sequencing is a technology that attempts to find the order of nucleotides that make up the DNA strand based on the complimentarity between the nucleotides - adenine and thymine or cytosine and guanine of complimentary strands form hydrogen bonds between each other.

2. Fluorescent label tagged nucleotides or sequence-specific restriction enzymes can be used to find the sequence of the DNA strand.

3. Applications - can check for mutations (changes in the base sequence) in the genome, identify and categorise organisms based on their genome sequence. It does not give expression status but more about the presence or absence of the DNA sequence element.

4. Technologies - Illumina, oxford nanopore, etc
